###HELLO  WORLD

**What is  Github?**

I really do not understand what this system /software is. It doesn't make too much sense to me, but  I'm trying to learn. 

Here's a link to a great article I found today at the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/03/movies/movie-trailers-october.html?contentCollection=smarter-living&hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0).

That is  _all_.
